>Course: CSCI 2020U: Software Systems Development and Integration

[![git](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/git?icon=git&label)](https://git-scm.com)

## Overview

In these labs, you will implement a grade calculator using both a website and a server similar to lab 7.

For the website, you'll create the GUI interface using JavaScript in order to make a table which can clear itself, add rows to itself and remove rows from itself.

>Basically, you'll be recreating [this](https://www.rapidtables.com/calc/grade/grade-calculator.html).

Finally, you'll implement the calculations and remaining logic on the backend by creating a new endpoint which reuses some of the code from the previous labs.

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes that you've completed every single lab before hand and all functionality from previous labs still works in this one.

You will need to copy over the following files:

```dir
api/ (lab 9)
  - src/main/java/com/example/lab6/
    - Student.java
    - FileFormatter.java
client/ (lab 8)
  - css/
    - styles.css
  - js/
    - main.js
  - index.hml
```

## Lab Work

See each subdirectory for instructions on what to do.
